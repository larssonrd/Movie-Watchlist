# Solo Project - Movie-Watchlist

This was a solo project I undertook through Scrimba, in which I received a Figma design file and instructions on how the app should function. No starting code was provided.

Besides the requirements, I added pagination, the ability to remove items from the watchlist, and responsiveness.

# Requirements
- Two pages - index.html and watchlist.html
- Index = search page. Calls to OMDB API with the title searched for and displays search results
- Button to "add to watchlist" which saves that data to local storage
- Watchlist.html loads and displays data from localstorage.
